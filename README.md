## üê£ Introduction

Denzel Washington is one of my favorite actor.

He won 2 Oscars. [Another 83 wins & 169 nominations](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000243/awards?ref_=nm_awd)

## üéØ Objectives

**Build a REST and GRAPHQL API to get the must-watch Denzel's movies**.

## üë©‚Äçüíª Just tell me what to do

1. Fork the project via `github`

![fork](./img/fork.png)

1. Clone your forked repository project `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/denzel`

```sh
‚ùØ cd /path/to/workspace
‚ùØ git clone git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/denzel.git
```

2. **[Do things](https://github.com/92bondstreet/denzel#%EF%B8%8F-steps-to-do)**

3. Commit your different modifications:

```sh
‚ùØ cd /path/to/workspace/denzel
‚ùØ git add -A && git commit -m "feat(movies): get a random movie"
‚ùØ git push origin master
```

([why following a commit message convention?](https://www.conventionalcommits.org))

4. Don't forget to commit early, commit often and push often

```sh
‚ùØ git push origin master
```

**Note**:

- If you catch an error about authentication, [add your ssh to your github profile](https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/).
- If you need some helps on git commands, read [git - the simple guide](http://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)

## Definition and Configuration

### Definition

- A **must-watch** movie is a movie with a `metascore` higher than `70`.
- API should listen locally the port `9292`.
- Data should be stored in MongoDB. Backed either with a DaaS: [mLab](https://mlab.com), [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) etc... Either with a [container Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/mvertes/alpine-mongo).
- To test and check your API, you should use a client like [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest) or [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/products)
- Deploy the API with a serverless cloud service: [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com), [Now](https://zeit.co/now) etc...

### Suggested node modules

- [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) - Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js
- [cheerio](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cheerio) - Fast, flexible & lean implementation of core jQuery designed specifically for the server
- [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) - Loads environment variables from .env for nodejs projects
- [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) - Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for node
- [graphql](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql) - A reference implementation of GraphQL for JavaScript
- [graphql-tools](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-tools) - Build, mock, and stitch a GraphQL schema using the schema language
- [mongodb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongodb) - Mongo DB Native NodeJS Driver
- [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) - Monitor for any changes in your node.js application and automatically restart the server - perfect for development

### Bootstrap the [server](./server/index.js)

```sh
‚ùØ cd server
‚ùØ npm i # or yarn
‚ùØ node_modules/.bin/nodemon index.js
```

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Steps to do

### REST endpoints to implement

#### `GET /movies/populate/:id`

Populate the database with all the [Denzel's movies from IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000243).

You could use the [server/imdb.js](./server/imdb.js) ready-to-use exported function.

```sh
‚ùØ curl -H "Accept: application/json" http://localhost:9292/movies/populate/nm0000243
{
  "total": 58
}
```

![populate](./img/populate.png)

Start [node server/sandbox.js](./server/sandbox.js) for an usage example.

```sh
‚ùØ node server/sandbox.js
üìΩÔ∏è  fetching filmography of nm0000243...
üçø 58 movies found.

}
```

#### POST /movies/:id

Save a watched date and a review.

This endpoint accepts the following post parameters:

- `date` - the watched date
- `review` - the personal review

```sh
‚ùØ curl -X POST -d '{"date": "2019-03-04", "review": "üòç üî•"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:9292/movies/tt0328107
{
  "_id": "507f191e810c19729de860ea"
}
```

### GraphQL endpoints to implement

Same definitions as REST API with `/graphql` endpoint.

- Populate the database
- Fetch a random **must-watch** movie
- Fetch a specific movie
- Search for Denzel's movies
- Save a watched date and a review.

#### (A suggested) Schema

```
schema {
  query Query
}

type Query {
  movies: [Movie]
  movie: Movie
}

type Movie {
  link: String
  metascore: Int
  synopsis: String
  title: String
  year: Int
}
```

```sh
‚ùØ curl -d '{"query": "movie {link metascore synopsis title year}"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://localhost:9292/graphql
{
  "data": {
    "movie": {
      "link": "https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0174856/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_23",
      "metascore": 74,
      "synopsis": "The story of Rubin \"Hurricane\" Carter, a boxer wrongly imprisoned for murder, and the people who aided in his fight to prove his innocence.",
      "title": "Hurricane Carter¬†(1999)",
      "year": 1999
    }
  }
}
```

### Bonus - The Client side

Build a client side web application.

The MVP definiton could be:

Each time, we open the web application or refresh the page, fetch a random **must-watch** movie and

- display the title
- display the synopsis
- display the cover
- display the metascore
- display the review
- allow to open the IMDb record
